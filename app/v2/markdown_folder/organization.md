# Organization

An organization in Choreo is a logical grouping of users and user resources. A first-time user must create an organization and be a member of it when signing in to Choreo. Users and resources in an organization cannot access resources in another organization unless an admin of the other organization invites them and adds them as a member of that organization. A user cannot create more than one organization.

## Switch organizations

If you are a member of more than one organization, you can switch from one organization to another when necessary. To do this, select the required organization from the **Organization** list in the Choreo Console header.

{% include "../administer/inviting-members.md" %}

## Manage user permission

Choreo manages user permissions with groups and roles.

### Groups

A group in Choreo is a collection of users, each with one or more roles assigned to them. Users within a group inherit the permissions associated with the roles assigned to that group. For instance, if a user is added to the `API Publisher` group, they will automatically receive the `API Publisher` role.

Choreo comes with predefined groups already configured with specific roles, as follows:

- **API Publisher**: A collection of users who have the API Publisher role.
- **API Subscriber**: A collection of users who have the API Subscriber role.
- **Admin** : A collection of users who have the Admin role.
- **Billing Admin** : A collection of users who have the Billing Admin role.
- **Choreo DevOps** : A collection of users who have the Choreo DevOps role.
- **Developer** : Users who develop, deploy, and manage cloud native applications at scale.
- **External API Subscriber**: A collection of users who have the External API Subscriber role.

When creating a new group to invite members, be sure to assign a role to the group to ensure users have the required permissions.

### Roles

Choreo roles are defined as follows:

- **Admin**: Performs all administrative tasks including user management, Developer Portal customization, project management, analytics configuration, and domain management.  
- **API Publisher**: Discovers, creates, publishes, deletes, tests, and manages APIs.  
- **API Subscriber**: Subscribes to APIs, manages subscriptions and applications, and generates and manages API keys.  
- **Billing Admin**: Handles billing administration including viewing tiers, managing organizations and invoices, and managing subscriptions and payment methods.  
- **Choreo DevOps**:   Manages deployment, monitoring, and reliability of components in Choreo.    
- **Choreo Platform Engineer**: Performs infrastructure, governance, service mesh, and monitoring tasks.  
- **Developer**: Develops, deploys, and manages cloud-native applications at scale.  
- **External API Subscriber**: Consumes APIs with Developer Portal access and can join an organization exclusively for API usage.  
- **Environment Manager (Deprecated):** Previously responsible for managing deployment environments.  

_Note: The **Choreo DevOps** role has been replaced with the **Choreo Platform Engineer** role. However, organizations that previously had Choreo DevOps role will continue to see and use both roles with their existing functionality._
