# Organization

An organization in Choreo is a logical grouping of users and user resources. A first-time user must create an organization and be a member of it when signing in to Choreo. Users and resources in an organization cannot access resources in another organization unless an admin of the other organization invites them and adds them as a member of that organization. A user cannot create more than one organization.

## Switch organizations

If you are a member of more than one organization, you can switch from one organization to another when necessary. To do this, select the required organization from the **Organization** list in the Choreo Console header.

## Manage user permission

Choreo manages user permissions with groups and roles.

### Groups

A group in Choreo is a collection of users, each with one or more roles assigned to them. Users within a group inherit the permissions associated with the roles assigned to that group. For instance, if a user is added to the `API Publisher` group, they will automatically receive the `API Publisher` role.

Choreo comes with predefined groups already configured with specific roles, as follows:

- **API Publisher**: A collection of users who have the API Publisher role.
- **API Subscriber**: A collection of users who have the API Subscriber role.
- **Admin** : A collection of users who have the Admin role.
- **Billing Admin** : A collection of users who have the Billing Admin role.
- **Choreo DevOps** : A collection of users who have the Choreo DevOps role.
- **Developer** : Users who develop, deploy, and manage cloud native applications at scale.
- **External API Subscriber**: A collection of users who have the External API Subscriber role.

When creating a new group to invite members, be sure to assign a role to the group to ensure users have the required permissions.

### Roles

Choreo roles are defined as follows:

- **API Publisher**: An API publisher can discover, create, publish, delete, test, and manage an API.
- **API Subscriber**: An API subscriber is a developer in a particular organization. An API subscriber can subscribe to an application, manage subscriptions, manage applications, generate API keys, and manage API keys.
