# Manage Members of an Organization

An organization in Choreo is a logical grouping of users and user resources. A first-time user must create an organization and be a user of it when signing in to Choreo. Users and resources in an organization cannot access resources in another organization unless an admin of the other organization invites them and adds them as a user of that organization.
