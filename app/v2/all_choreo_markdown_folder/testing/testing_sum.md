        !!! tip
            For `Postman Collections`:

            -  The default behavior is to run all the collections in the specified directory.
            -  To run specific collections in the directory, use `-f` or `--files` as the first argument, followed by a comma-separated list of collections.
            -  Since Choreo uses [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) internally to run Postman Collections, you can pass any valid Newman arguments.


# Test GraphQL Endpoints via the GraphQL Console

Choreo provides an integrated GraphQL Console to test publicly exposed GraphQL endpoints of Service components you create and deploy. The GraphQL Console allows you to write queries and mutations interactively. As Choreo uses OAuth2.0 authentication by default to secure GraphQL APIs, the GraphQL Console generates test keys to test APIs.

Follow the steps below to test a GraphQL endpoint via the GraphQL Console:

1. Sign in to the [Choreo Console](https://console.choreo.dev/).

2. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component you want to test.

3. Click **Test** in the left navigation menu and then click **Console**. This opens the **GraphQL Console** pane.

4. In the **GraphQL Console** pane, select the environment from the drop-down list.

5. Select the required endpoint from the **Endpoint** list.

    !!! note
        - The **Network Visibilities** of an endpoint are set in the **component.yaml**. You can set any combination of **Public**, **Organization**, or **Project**.
        - If you have set the **Network Visibilities** of the endpoint in the **component.yaml** to **Public**, continue with step 7. 
        - If you have set the **Network Visibilities** of the endpoint in the **component.yaml** to **Organization**, the GraphQL endpoint will not be invokable from outside the organization. In this instance, for testing purposes, Choreo allows you to generate a temporay test URL that will be active for 15 minutes. Execute step 6 to generate the temporary URL. 
        
6. If the **Network Visibilities** of the endpoint contains **Organization**, click on **Generate URL** to generate a temporary test URL that will be active for 15 minutes. Else, skip this step. 

    !!! note
        The temporay test URL will be available **only for 15 minutes** and it will get expired after. You can deactivate the test URL by clicking on the **Deactivate URL** button.

        - The **Network Visibility** of an endpoint is configured in the **component.yaml** file. You can set it to **Public**, **Organization**, or **Project**.
        - If the **Network Visibility** is set to **Public**, skip to step 7.
        - If the **Network Visibility** is set to **Organization**, the endpoint is not publicly accessible. However, Choreo allows you to generate a temporary test URL for testing purposes. This URL is publicly accessible (secured with OAuth 2.0) and remains active for 15 minutes. To generate the temporary URL, proceed to step 6.

6. Generate a temporary test URL (if applicable):  
   If the **Network Visibility** is set to **Organization**, click **Generate URL** to create a temporary test URL. This URL will be active for 15 minutes. If the visibility is not set to **Organization**, skip this step.

    !!! note
        The temporary test URL is valid for **15 minutes only** and will expire afterward. You can manually deactivate it by clicking the **Deactivate URL** button.

    ![OpenAPI Console](../assets/img/testing/openapi-console-org.png){.cInlineImage-full}

By default, Choreo secures WebSocket APIs with OAuth 2.0, and the console automatically generates test keys for authenticated API testing.

Follow these steps to test a WebSocket endpoint using the WebSocket Console:

1. Go to the [Choreo Console](https://console.choreo.dev/) and log in.
2. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component you want to test.
3. Click **Test** in the left navigation menu, then select **Console**. This opens the **WebSocket Console** pane.
4. In the **WebSocket Console** pane, select the desired environment from the drop-down list.
5. Choose the endpoint you want to test from the **Endpoint** list.

    !!! note
        - The **Network Visibility** of an endpoint is configured in the **endpoints.yaml** file. You can set it to **Public**, **Organization**, or **Project**.
        - If the **Network Visibility** is set to **Public**, proceed to step 7.
        - If the **Network Visibility** is set to **Organization**, the endpoint won't be accessible outside the organization. For testing, Choreo allows you to generate a temporary URL that remains active for 15 minutes. Follow step 6 to generate the URL.

6. Generate a temporary URL (if applicable): 
   If the **Network Visibility** is set to **Organization**, click **Generate URL** to create a temporary test URL valid for 15 minutes. Otherwise, skip this step.

    !!! note
        The temporary test URL is valid for **15 minutes** and will expire afterward. To manually deactivate it, click **Deactivate URL**.

7. Once the execution is completed it is listed on the execution page. This may take some time. Once the execution is listed, you can click on a particular execution to view the test result(s).

    !!! info "Inject dynamic values into your application as command-line arguments"
         If you want to inject dynamic values into your application as command-line arguments when you run a test runner component, follow the steps given below:

           1. Click the drop-down icon next to **Run Now** and then click **Run with Arguments**. 
           2. In the **Runtime Arguments** pane that opens, enter the arguments you want to pass to your application. 
           3. Click **Execute**. This triggers the test runner with the specified arguments.
    
        !!! tip
            For `Postman Collections`:

            -  The default behavior is to run all the collections in the specified directory.
            -  To run specific collections in the directory, use `-f` or `--files` as the first argument, followed by a comma-separated list of collections.
            -  Since Choreo uses [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) internally to run Postman Collections, you can pass any valid Newman arguments.


# Test GraphQL Endpoints via the GraphQL Console

Choreo provides an integrated GraphQL Console to test publicly exposed GraphQL endpoints of Service components you create and deploy. The GraphQL Console allows you to write queries and mutations interactively. As Choreo uses OAuth2.0 authentication by default to secure GraphQL APIs, the GraphQL Console generates test keys to test APIs.

Follow the steps below to test a GraphQL endpoint via the GraphQL Console:

1. Sign in to the [Choreo Console](https://console.choreo.dev/).

2. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component you want to test.

3. Click **Test** in the left navigation menu and then click **Console**. This opens the **GraphQL Console** pane.

4. In the **GraphQL Console** pane, select the environment from the drop-down list.

5. Select the required endpoint from the **Endpoint** list.

    !!! note
        - The **Network Visibilities** of an endpoint are set in the **component.yaml**. You can set any combination of **Public**, **Organization**, or **Project**.
        - If you have set the **Network Visibilities** of the endpoint in the **component.yaml** to **Public**, continue with step 7. 
        - If you have set the **Network Visibilities** of the endpoint in the **component.yaml** to **Organization**, the GraphQL endpoint will not be invokable from outside the organization. In this instance, for testing purposes, Choreo allows you to generate a temporay test URL that will be active for 15 minutes. Execute step 6 to generate the temporary URL. 
        
6. If the **Network Visibilities** of the endpoint contains **Organization**, click on **Generate URL** to generate a temporary test URL that will be active for 15 minutes. Else, skip this step. 

    !!! note
        The temporay test URL will be available **only for 15 minutes** and it will get expired after. You can deactivate the test URL by clicking on the **Deactivate URL** button.

7. Enter the API path and the query or mutation you want to test.

8. Click the play icon.

    !!! tip
        If you want to generate a required query or mutation for testing via the GraphQL Explorer, click **Explorer** to open the GraphQL Explorer.
    
    !!! note
         GraphQL Explorer has a known issue causing improper construction of list inputs. To work around this, you must manually update the list input in the generated query before executing it.

        - The **Network Visibility** of an endpoint is configured in the **component.yaml** file. You can set it to **Public**, **Organization**, or **Project**.
        - If the **Network Visibility** is set to **Public**, skip to step 7.
        - If the **Network Visibility** is set to **Organization**, the endpoint is not publicly accessible. However, Choreo allows you to generate a temporary test URL for testing purposes. This URL is publicly accessible (secured with OAuth 2.0) and remains active for 15 minutes. To generate the temporary URL, proceed to step 6.

6. Generate a temporary test URL (if applicable):  
   If the **Network Visibility** is set to **Organization**, click **Generate URL** to create a temporary test URL. This URL will be active for 15 minutes. If the visibility is not set to **Organization**, skip this step.

    !!! note
        The temporary test URL is valid for **15 minutes only** and will expire afterward. You can manually deactivate it by clicking the **Deactivate URL** button.
