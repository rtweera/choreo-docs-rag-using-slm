## Private Data Plane Management Models

This section outlines the roles and responsibilities for managing Private Data Planes (PDPs) under different models:

*   **WSO2 Fully Managed (Infrastructure and PDP in WSO2 Subscription):** WSO2 is responsible for most tasks including subscription prerequisites, remote access, network and firewall management, infrastructure provisioning, Kubernetes cluster management, choreo system components deployment, monitoring, and security monitoring. The customer is responsible for Choreo application creation/deployment, management, monitoring, and logs.
*   **WSO2 Fully Managed (Infrastructure and PDP in Customer Subscription):**  The customer is responsible for subscription prerequisites and providing remote access. Other responsibilities are shared between WSO2 and the customer.
*   **Customer Self-Managed (WSO2 Provides Installation Script and Updates):** The customer handles most tasks.

## Private Data Plane Security Levels

This section outlines the security features available at different tiers for private data planes:

*   **Basic Tier:** Foundational security features.
*   **Standard Tier:** Includes basic features plus Kubernetes runtime protection and WAF.
*   **Premium Tier:** Includes standard features plus a network firewall.

## Troubleshoot Choreo

This section provides solutions to common problems encountered while using Choreo.

*   **Angular Web App Displays Nginx Welcome Page:** Ensure the build output directory is correctly specified during component creation.
*   **Trivy Scan Error in BYOC:** Fix the identified vulnerability or add a `.trivyignore` file to the Docker build context path.
*   **config.js File Not Properly Mounted:** Add the `config.js` file to the `app/public` directory and reference it in the `index.html` file.
*   **React App Renders Unexpected HTML:** Reference the `config.js` file in the `index.html` file and ensure the path is correct.
*   **Commits Triggering Automatic Build:** Merge commits and commits pushed directly to the branch can trigger a build.
*   **Nginx Welcome Page After Building a Web App:** Check Docker build logs to ensure the correct files are copied during the build process.
*   **Preferred Language Not Available as a Buildpack:** Use the Dockerfile buildpack.
*   **Incorrect Build Command:** Update the build command in the build configurations section on the build page of the component.
*   **Cannot Add Users with Managed Authentication:** Follow the steps to manage users with Choreo's built-in IDP or set up other OpenID Connect (OIDC) supported IDPs.
*   **Tailscale Proxy Issues:**

    *   **Troubleshooting Logs:** View runtime logs of the running container for the Tailscale proxy deployment.
    *   **Authentication Failure:** Re-check the `TS_AUTH_KEY` for misconfiguration, or generate a new key if it has expired.
    *   **Cannot Access Private Endpoints:** Ensure the on-premises setup is properly connected to the Tailscale network, and verify that the IP addresses and ports in the `Config.yaml` and `endpoints.yaml` files are correct.
