 # Deploy a Web Application that Consumes a Backend Service

Choreo is an Internal Developer Platform (IDevP) that simplifies building, deploying, monitoring, and managing cloud-native applications.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Expose a service endpoint via Choreo.
- Securely consume the service from a web application.
- Use Choreo's managed authentication to set up authentication for your web application without dealing with complex security protocols.

The sample web application allows users to:
- Sign in and view their reading lists.
- Add books to a reading list.
- Delete books from the reading list.
- Sign out of the application.

This guide walks you through the following steps:

1. Deploy and test a service component.
2. Create a web application to consume the service.
3. Create a connection to the deployed service.
4. Enable managed authentication and deploy the web application.
5. Consume the deployed service via the web application.

## Prerequisites

1. GitHub account: Fork the [Choreo sample book list app repository](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-sample-book-list-app), which contains the sample for this guide.

2. If you're signing in to the Choreo Console for the first time, create an organization:
    1. Go to [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev/) and sign in using your Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account.
    2. Enter a unique organization name. For example, `Stark Industries`.
    3. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms of use.
    4. Click **Create**.

    This creates the organization and opens the organization home page.

## Step 1: Create a project

1. Go to [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev/) and sign in. This opens the organization home page.
2. On the organization home page, click **+ Create Project**.

    | **status**    | to_read       |
    | **title**     | Dracula       |

    The request body should look like this:

    ```json
    {
      "author": "Bram Stoker",
      "status": "to_read",
      "title": "Dracula"
    }
    ```

8. Click **Execute**.

    Check the **Server Response** section. On successful invocation, you will receive the `201` HTTP code.

You can also try out the **GET** and **DELETE** methods.

## Step 6: Consume the service

Now that the `Reading List Service` is deployed and available in the Choreo Marketplace, you can discover and consume it. In this section, you will deploy a front-end application to interact with the service.

    !!! note
        The **Choreo GitHub App** requires:

        - Read and write access to code and pull requests.
        - Read access to issues and metadata.

        You can [revoke access](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-authorized-integrations#reviewing-your-authorized-github-apps) at any time. Write access is only used for sending pull requests; Choreo will not push changes directly to your repository.

5. Enter the following information:

    | **Field**             | **Description**                  |
    |-----------------------|----------------------------------|

    ```javascript
    window.configs = {
        apiUrl: '<Service URL>',
    };
    ```

    !!! tip
        You can refer to the configuration file mounted at `/app/public` as `./public/config.js` within your web application.

4. Click **Next** to open the **Authentication** pane.
5. Under **Authentication Settings**, ensure that **Managed authentication with Choreo** is enabled.

 # Deploy a Web Application that Consumes a Backend Service

Choreo is an Internal Developer Platform (IDevP) that simplifies building, deploying, monitoring, and managing cloud-native applications.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Expose a service endpoint via Choreo.
- Securely consume the service from a web application.
- Use Choreo's managed authentication to set up authentication for your web application without dealing with complex security protocols.

The sample web application allows users to:
- Sign in and view their reading lists.
- Add books to a reading list.
- Delete books from the reading list.
- Sign out of the application.

This guide walks you through the following steps:

1. Deploy and test a service component.
2. Create a web application to consume the service.
3. Create a connection to the deployed service.
4. Enable managed authentication and deploy the web application.
5. Consume the deployed service via the web application.

## Prerequisites
