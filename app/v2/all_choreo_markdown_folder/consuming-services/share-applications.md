2. On the **Applications** page, click on the application you want to share.

3. On the **Application Overview** page, click the **Share** button on the right side.

4. In the **Share Application** dialog, enter the email addresses of the members you want to share the application with.

    !!! note
        You must type an email address and press **Enter** to add it.

5. Click **Confirm**. The application will be shared in read-only mode with the specified members.

To view the members with whom the application is shared, go to the **Application Overview** page and check the email addresses listed in the **Shared with** field.
