# Rename API Display Name

Choreo allows you to make one or more endpoints accessible through its service and integration components. These endpoints are published as individual APIs in Choreo, accessible via the Choreo Developer Portal. By default, Choreo assigns an API name by combining the component name and the endpoint name, resulting in the following format: `<component name>-<endpoint name>`. For example, if you create a component named `Ballerina Reading List,` the API is displayed as `Ballerina Reading List - GraphQL Reading List 591.`

Choreo provides you with the flexibility to personalize the display name of the API, enhancing its user-friendliness and readability. Once you modify the API display name within the Choreo Console, Choreo applies the change immediately. From there onwards, Choreo displays the published API by this name in the Choreo Developer Portal.

Follow the steps below to rename the API display name:

1. Go to [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev/cloud-native-app-developer) and sign in. This opens the project home page.
2. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component for which you want to rename the API display name. This opens the **Overview** page of the component.
3. In the left navigation menu, click **Manage** and then click **API Info**.
4. On the **API Info** page that opens, click the **Developer Portal** tab.
5. Under **General Details**, specify an appropriate API display name in the **Name** field.
6. Click **Save**.

Now, you can view the updated API display name in the Choreo Developer Portal.
